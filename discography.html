<p id="margin-top">Lana Del Rey's style of music is characterized by a unique and atmospheric blend of various genres, resulting in a
    sound that is both nostalgic and contemporary. Her musical palette encompasses elements of pop, rock, indie,
    hip-hop, and cinematic orchestration, creating a signature style that is often described as "baroque pop" or "indie
    pop."
    The genre fluidity within Lana Del Rey's discography is striking. She seamlessly incorporates hip-hop beats, rock
    guitars, and electronic production, creating a genre-defying experience. This willingness to experiment and fuse
    genres contributes to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of her music.
    A recurring theme in Lana Del Rey's work, especially her album "Born To Die" is her fascination with Americana. Her
    songs often weave in references to American culture, exploring both its glamorous façade and its darker, more
    complex aspects. This thematic exploration adds a layer of depth to her storytelling and contributes to the overall
    richness of her artistic vision.
    Lana Del Rey's musical and artistic palette is shaped by a diverse array of influences, reflecting her broad
    appreciation for different genres and styles. Her eclectic taste encompasses classic rock, hip-hop, old Hollywood
    glamour, and alternative acts, creating a rich and unique foundation for her own distinctive sound.
    Classic rock icons have played a significant role in shaping Lana's artistic sensibilities. The storytelling prowess
    of Bob Dylan, the poetic lyricism of Leonard Cohen, and the evocative narratives of Bruce Springsteen have all left
    an indelible mark on her approach to songwriting. These influences contribute to the narrative-driven and
    introspective nature of her lyrics.
    Marilyn Monroe, representing the glamour of old Hollywood, is referenced in one of her songs, Body Electric, as
    another symbol of that aesthetic. Same goes for Elvis Presley, mentioned in the same lyric "Elvis is my daddy,
    Marilyn's my mother".
    Beyond the realm of music, Lana Del Rey draws inspiration from literary figures such as Vladimir Nabokov and Allen
    Ginsberg. This literary influence suggests a deeper artistic curiosity that extends into the realms of literature
    and poetry, influencing her ability to craft intricate and thought-provoking narratives.
    The Beach Boys and their representation of California culture also play a role in Lana's influences. The harmonies
    and the sun-soaked West Coast imagery present in The Beach Boys' music align with themes explored in Lana's own
    discography, particularly those related to California and its cultural influences, for example her album "Norman
    Fucking Rockwell".
