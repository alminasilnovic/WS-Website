    <!-- Introduction paragraph about Lana Del Rey's musical style and influences -->
    <p id="margin-top">Lana Del Rey's style of music is characterized by a unique and atmospheric blend of various genres, resulting in a
        sound that is both nostalgic and contemporary. Her musical palette encompasses elements of pop, rock, indie,
        hip-hop, and cinematic orchestration, creating a signature style that is often described as "baroque pop" or "indie
        pop."
        The genre fluidity within Lana Del Rey's discography is striking. She seamlessly incorporates hip-hop beats, rock
        guitars, and electronic production, creating a genre-defying experience. This willingness to experiment and fuse
        genres contributes to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of her music.
        A recurring theme in Lana Del Rey's work, especially her album "Born To Die" is her fascination with Americana. Her
        songs often weave in references to American culture, exploring both its glamorous fa√ßade and its darker, more
        complex aspects. This thematic exploration adds a layer of depth to her storytelling and contributes to the overall
        richness of her artistic vision.
        Lana Del Rey's musical and artistic palette is shaped by a diverse array of influences, reflecting her broad
        appreciation for different genres and styles. Her eclectic taste encompasses classic rock, hip-hop, old Hollywood
        glamour, and alternative acts, creating a rich and unique foundation for her own distinctive sound.
        Classic rock icons have played a significant role in shaping Lana's artistic sensibilities. The storytelling prowess
        of Bob Dylan, the poetic lyricism of Leonard Cohen, and the evocative narratives of Bruce Springsteen have all left
        an indelible mark on her approach to songwriting. These influences contribute to the narrative-driven and
        introspective nature of her lyrics.
        Marilyn Monroe, representing the glamour of old Hollywood, is referenced in one of her songs, Body Electric, as
        another symbol of that aesthetic. Same goes for Elvis Presley, mentioned in the same lyric "Elvis is my daddy,
        Marilyn's my mother".
        Beyond the realm of music, Lana Del Rey draws inspiration from literary figures such as Vladimir Nabokov and Allen
        Ginsberg. This literary influence suggests a deeper artistic curiosity that extends into the realms of literature
        and poetry, influencing her ability to craft intricate and thought-provoking narratives.
        The Beach Boys and their representation of California culture also play a role in Lana's influences. The harmonies
        and the sun-soaked West Coast imagery present in The Beach Boys' music align with themes explored in Lana's own
        discography, particularly those related to California and its cultural influences, for example her album "Norman
        Fucking Rockwell".
